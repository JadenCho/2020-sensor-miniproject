# 2020 Sensor Miniproject - Jaden Cho & Maxine Loebs  
## Task 0 - Set up Python Websockets
After running the code, we see that the greeting string issued is **ECE Senior Capstone IoT Simulator** 

## Task 1 - Data Flow
Below is our code (added to client.py), which saves the incoming JSON data to a text file. You pass the name of the file you want to write to into the command line. For example, *python -m sp_iotsim.client mydata.txt* would save the incoming data into a text file called mydata.

Put code here!!!!!

## Task 2  - Analysis
We chose to look at the data from the office. 
1. The median of the temperature data is () and the variance is ().  
2. The median of the occupancy data is () and the variance is ().  
3. Here are the histogram plots for each sensor type:  
4. The mean of of the time intervals is () and the variance is (). Here is the probability density as a histogram:
