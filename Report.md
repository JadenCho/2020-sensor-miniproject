After running the code, we see that the greeting string issued is **ECE Senior Capstone IoT Simulator** 

## Task 1 - Data Flow
Below is our code, which saves the incoming JSON data to a text file:  

## Task 2  - Analysis
We chose to look at the data from the office. 
1. The median of the temperature data is () and the variance is ().  
2. The median of the occupancy data is () and the variance is ().  
3. Here are the histogram plots for each sensor type:  
4. The mean of of the time intervals is () and the variance is (). Here is the probability density as a histogram:
